## The Past
Life in the Great Plains was simple, but has never been easy. Being a vast land with huge herds of horses and bisons the land was practically made for cattle holding. Just some farmers, who prefered solitude over the madness of the city, claimed their little part of the wide fields beneath the very few enormous trees in the otherwise empty land.

Small farms joined together over the course of the years, and the little city Dunwich sprouted in the center of these plains. Farmers began to crave modernization, a change. The younger people wanted more than just taking over the farm, they dreamed of becoming successful. At the same time, a big investor saw his chance. A butchery was build, in reality it was just simple work, but for the people it was hope. The hope that more factories will come and more factories mean more modernization. Naturally most of the younger people started working there. The butchery was a great success.

## The Meteorite
With the day the meteorite came, the animals vanished. Rumours went through the town, people thought the animals must have been released or even stolen. The farmers united to search for their missing cattle, but something was clearly off. Just a few farmers returned, reporting of monsters, that roam the land. It was not safe anymore. No cattle meant no work for the butchery, so it was closed soon after. With that many left Dunwich until the point it was just a shadow of the former idillic city. Most of the abandoned parts were overrun by the beasts soon after. The only remaining people gathered around the church, which is overshadowed by the skeleton like remains of the old butchery.

## A new chance?
No one expected people to return to this godforsaken plains, but some did. Claiming the old farmes a new kind of Cowboys tried to return to a simple live, keeping the beasts which now roam the land. Trying to catch them many died, but they did not give up. They returned once again to a simple live, living of what the monsters provided for them. Some were even friendly, big lizard-like creatures in vibrant red and yellow colors, called lurkers, which walk on two strong legs, were used instead of horses.

None of these farmers managed to be overly successfull, but a group which called themselves the Successors seemed to be particularly lucky. They gathered around the old church of Dunwich, or at least what was left of it. Most of the other farmers try to stay as far away from this place. One reason is the old butchery, the people say it is a bad omen, the other reason are the people. The Successors are as strange as sucessful. They openly accept people who agree to follow them. Everybody else, especially the ones who ask to much questions arenâ€˜t welcome there.

## The Successors
As the farmers returned to the plains only a few were brave enought to settle down in Dunwich. The group which called themselves the Successors claimed the old houses around the church. As crazy as they are, they seem to be overly lucky with taiming the beasts. Some wanted to learn their secrets and joined them. These people changed - they did not talk about what happened, they did not talk to any outsiders to be more precise. They joined the Successors and left their families behind, yearning for success they gave up their farm. The other farmers were intrigued and tried to catch a glimpse of what is happening in the church near the old butchery. They saw the Successors, followed by Beasts which behave like pets, walking into the old butchery. Did they open a barn in there? Do they eat those Beasts? Anyways, the people entering the butchery return without their beasts, so it seems that they stay in there. That was all people found out. One tried to enter the old butchery in the morining, when the Successors were out, trying to catch more beasts. He never returned, since then the farmers do not ask questions anymore. As long as there are beasts left to catch, the farmers try to continue living their simple life.
