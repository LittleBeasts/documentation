# Ivory Forest
The Antagonist of Ivory Forest is a crazy old man who was once a professor at the Miskatonic University of Arkham City. He held Lectures in advanced Biological Science but soon got suspended. With his suspension he left Arkham City and chose to live inside of Ivory Forest as a hermit. He has a little House in the wilderness where he continued with his research. Before the meteor he got visited quite frequently but today no one dares to take a step inside Ivory Forest. No one knows what drove this brilliant mind crazy and why he got suspended. The Antagonists main goal is to expand the power of Vh‘yrr‘kll from outside of his city / dimension into the real world.

# Miskatonic Mountains
The Mi-Go have started their experiments combining the genomes of the littleBeasts with each other and even humans. The results of their research was mostly just non-functioning biomass, but one experiment was successfull and not only did the new lifeform have immense physical abilities, but also telekinesis and mindreading capabilities which even surprised the Mi-Go. Perhaps they shouldn't have mixed their own DNA in with that of everything else.

# Marshlands
The people of Innsmouth are a tight group which won't let anyone in, who has not been born one of them. It is hard to see who is in charge of the bunch, but one can only assume that the old Madame Winchester has alot of influence in the small town. The people get awfully quiet when she is around and even the toughest sailors in town are wary to look her into the eyes. It will probably be better to not cross paths with her.

# Arkham City
Agent Strongarm has the control over the whole city since the FBI arrived in town. She is not only tough on crime, but also tough on her own people. So much so that the people under her grow restless. Since her arrival in town she has established a city wide curfew and anyone who doesn't follow her rules is harshly punished. Every day she ventures further down into the crater and no one know what she expects to find, but as time passes, she escalates more and terrifies the people of Arkham.
