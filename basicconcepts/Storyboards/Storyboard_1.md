## Day 1
---
### Scene 1 - At Home
---
Protagonist wakes up and starts into the day.
They stand next to their bed and talk to their pet.
P: "Hey sweety, did you also have a strange dream?" <br>
K: "Meow!" <br>
P: "Something is not right, I should talk to the Professor." <br>
K: "Meow?" <br>
P: "Let's got to his office!"

Tutorial - Game controlls

Player can explore

Player starts in a small dorm room on the new campus.

### Scene 2 - At the Proffesors Office
---
Protagonist in the office.<br>
P: "Hello Proffesor!"<br>
Prof W.: "Hello *name*, did you find some rest?"<br>
P: "I couldn't say... I had this dream again."<br>
Prof W.: "..."<br>
P: "Didn't we do everything as it is written in the books? Why won't "they" leave me alone.<br>
Prof W.: "..."<br>
P: "Proffesor? Don't tell me it was all for nothing!!"<br>
Prof W.: "No need to be overly dramatic, we did everything right. You need to give it more time, your soul hasn't relized the new situation yet."<br>
P: "What should I do?"<br>
Prof W.: "I have a small task for you, this will surely lift up your spirits."<br>
P: "Nods"<br>
Prof W.: "A new artifact made it's way to town. With it we can finally make everything right. Have you ever heard of Lois?"<br>
P: "Shakes head"<br>
Prof. W.: "She is an old friend of mine, got to her and tell her I sent you to receive the "item". Can you do that for me?"<br>
P: "You know I can! I will bring it to you ASAP."<br>

Protagonist can look around the room to interact with items. (Perhaps loot)

On the way from New Campus to the City there is rough terrain where Little Beasts hang around. Perhaps a battle tutorial.

### Scene 3 - Flea Market
---
Flea Market is a busy street in the Arkham habour district. Here you can find fresh fish and other not so legal goods.

Louis has her own little Store called Ls Import and Export.

Lois: "How can I help you honey? You seem lost."<br>
P: "Are you Lois?"<br>
Lois: "The one and only, who is asking?"<br>
P: "I'm *name*, Proffesor Weintraub has sent me to get an "item".<br>
Lois: "You work with that old geezer? My condolences. But business is business. Yeah I heard chatter on the streets that someone is willing to surrender it for the right price.<br>
P: "And what would that price be?"<br>
Lois "A piece of the meteor of course, that's is all the rage right now."<br>
P: "I see what I can do."<br>
Lois: "I would take a look around the meteor crater if I where you, perhaps you will get lucky."<br>

Interactions in Store. (Perhaps you can buy stuff from her)

### Scene 4 - Meteor Crater
---
The meteor crater is taped off by the F.B.I.. An agent is right at the front looking all important.

Agent Scully: "What do you think you are doing here?!?"<br>
P: "I'm just having a stroll through the park."<br>
Agent Scully: "Then stroll somewhere else, will you?!"<br>

You are booted from the crater map.

P: "I need a way to find a piece of the meteor. Perhaps someone saw something"

P: Can interact with NPCs which will tell them, that they saw a homeless around.

### Scene 5 - Licoln Park
---
In the Park you find Stinky Pete, a long time Homeless.

P: "Hello Pete."<br>
SP: "Stinky Pete if you will!"<br>
P: "I'm sorry - Stinky Pete."<br>
SP: "Manners are important."<br>
P: "Word is that you are the one to come to, for meteorite scraps."<br>
SP: "Perhaps."<br>
P: "Perhaps we can make a deal?"<br>
SP: "Actually I lost something - My lucky bottle, it fell right down a storm drain, when the F.B.I. people removed me from my usual spot. When you find it we can be friends."<br>
P: "We'll do."<br>

You can see something shiny down a stormdrain. But you have no way of reaching it.

### Scene 6 - The first Catch
---
The entrance of the sewers is at Flea Market, but it is locked.
Interaction with sewer Door: "Perhaps Lois knows how to open this door."

Lois has a Key, but she wants you to catch her a Little Beast.

Lois: "Hello Hon, back already? You are quick to deliver."<br>
P: "I don't have it yet, but I have a source."<br>
Lois: "Uhh, how facinating."<br>
P: "I need to get into the sewers, do you know a way in?"<br>
Lois: "Of course I do. But it comes at a price. Catch me on of those Beasts and you can have the key, here take this cage."<br>

She gives you a cage. (Perhaps catching tutorial)

After Protagonist cought the beast you can give it to Lois to get the "Sewer Key"

You can enter the sewers now. Sewer is a dungeon which contains a high amount of Little Beasts.
At the end of one of the paths there is the Bottle it is engraved.
The engraving reads: "To my love"
It seems to be empty probably never used.

### Scene 7 - Heroes reward
---
You bring back the Bottle and get a piece of the meteorite from Steve.<br>
SP: "Thank you stranger, your good manners will be rewarded."

### Scene 8 - Doing business
---
Back at Ls Import and Export you give the meteorite to Lois.

Lois: "Well look at that, I was kidding, but you did it anyway. I should ask you more often to retrieve items for me. Tell the Professor that I will get the "item" for him and he can lay his rotting head to rest"

### Scene 9 - Back at new Campus
---
Prof W.: "She is always a blast, you did good. Rest now, tommorow will be a huge day for you and me, we need to be at our best."

You can go back to your room and sleep.

## Day 2
---
You get up again.

Cat: "Meow?"<br>
P: "No, the dream is still there."<br>
Cat: "Meow?"<br>
P: "You're right, I should talk to the Professor again."<br>

As you leave you room, you find Little Beast roaming in places that where save before.

You make your way to the Prof. office, he is not there.
(Perhaps destroyed)

The City still seems to be safe from the Beasts.

You can ask Lois where the Professor is.

### Scene 1
---
Lois: "You look dreadfull hon, what happened"<br>
P: "I can't find the Proffesor, do you have an idea where he could be?"<br>
Lois: "We met today at the break of dawn, always a good time for a deal, not that there is a bad time to earn some money."<br>
P: "Do you know where he went after that?"<br>
Lois: "Not really. The old man said something about "only one thing is missing now" and then left."<br>
P: "Thank you Lois."<br>
Lois: "Don't mention it, I mean it. My reputation is important for my business."<br>

You can walk around the city to look for the Professor, some NPCs tell you they saw him go into the antiquariate.

### Scene 2 - Mr. Paulsens Antiquariate
---
The antiquariate is a curious place, behind the counter is a man.

Mr. Paulsen: "Please don't touch anything."<br>
P: "Have you seen Professor Weintraub today?"<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "No... I have not. Why would you think that?"<br>
P: "I was told he was here."<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "Okay okay, stop the interrogation, I confess. He was here."<br>
P: "I wasn't... I ..."<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "And I gave him what he wanted... I'm ashamed myself."<br>
P: "And what would that be?"<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "I is a book."<br>
P: "... that much was obvious."<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "I guess your right, but it was not any old book. This book has power"<br>
P: "What do you mean."<br>
Mr. Paulsen: "I can't tell you more otherwise you would be doomed too. Just leave it at that and hope that the Professor will never use it. You need to go now"<br>

You're kicked out.

P: "What do you make of this?"<br>
Cat: "Meow!"<br>
P: "That sound dangerous. But you are right, we need to find the Professor."<br>

When you go back to the crater the F.B.I. agent is missing. And you can explore the region.

As you work your way down the crater you find the Agent.

### Scene 3 - The F.B.I.
---
Agent Scully: "What are you doing here, do you work with that lunatic old geezer?"<br>
P: "Have you seen the Profssor"<br>
Agent Scully: "Do I look like someone who cares about the academic title of someone who attacks me?!?"<br>
P: "What do you mean?"<br>
Agent Scully: "The old fart came up to me and hit me on the head, next thing I knew we were down here and he cut my arm with a strange knife, said something and this doorway opened."<br>
P: "I need to go after him!"<br>
Agent Scully: "Do what you want, but leave me out of it, when you come back out there will be dozens of agent waiting for the both of you.<br>

The doorway lead to old catacombs which seem to be inside the meteor.
They are of a strange alien design.

It is swarmed with Little Beasts.

At the end of the way you find an altar with the Professor standing right in front of it.

### Scene 4 - The finale
---
Prof. W.: "I knew you would come my child."<br>
P: "What are you doing Professor?"<br>
Prof. W.: "As soon as I heard of your dreams, I knew it had to be you!"<br>
P: "Professor? What are you talking about?"<br>
Prof. W.: "Come here my child, fullfill your destiny!"<br>
P walks forcibly to the shrine<br>
P: "Proffesor, why can't I stop?"<br>
Prof. W.: "We will end it here, right now. Believe me, it will be great."<br>
P is almost at the shrine.<br>
Cat: "Meow!!"<br>
Cat hits Professor releasing you from the hold.

Final battle against the Professor.
He transforms ("Not even my finalform-style")

After the battle the whole catacombs start shaking.
You need to run outside.
Outside the F.B.I. is waiting.

Agent Scully: "What happened, are you O.K.?"<br>
P: "I don't know, the Professor, he wasn't himself... I think..."<br>
Agent Scully: "It is alright, we will take it from here."<br>

You're in the City again.

P: "What do you think did the Professor talk about?"<br>
Cat: "Meow?"<br>
P: "You're right: Thank you *name* for saving me in there. Your treats are well earned."<br>
Cat: "Meow!!"
