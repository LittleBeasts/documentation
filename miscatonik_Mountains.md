## The Pass
In the mountains to the west strange things are happening. As of recently people who try to travel along the Miskatonic pass are not arriving at their destination and people clain to have seen strange 'birds' flying around the mountain tops. But no one who has seen these flying beings has enough sanity left in him/her to accurately describe what they have seen.

The police of Arkham did not investigate these claims, they are streched thin as it is and don't find the hear say they are provided with as sufficent evindence to open a case. But as of now, no one tries to get into the mountains anymore and even the littleBeasts are scarce in this region.

## Mi-Go
But the rumours won't just go away and a desrciption of the flying things hardens as more and more people talk about them.

The Mi-Go are a space travelling alien race who are technological more advanced than anything humankind can imagine. And they kidnap humans and littleBeasts alike to have them take part in their experiments.

## Old Yarnam
The only reason to travel far up in these mountains is the little village Old Yarnam. In the past it used to be the base of geologists, who found metals and gems which are of great importance for the high society of Arkham. A mine was founded and miners began to settle there, regularly caravans which brought supplies traveled through the mountains to the mining village. Since the littleBeasts appeared noone managed to reach the village. No signal came from the village, so it was presumed lost. After a few days they send a message via radio in which they claimed to be saved. Some kind of angels seem to protect the village from any harm that the monsters that roam the mountains might cause. Moreover the people of Old Yarnam exclaimed that the angels are a sign of God, not only do they care for the people, they regularely choose one to join them as one of their own. All attempts to reach the village failed. It is not clear whether they do not want to respond or if they can't. A team was send to reach the village and check for the survivors, but the team never returned. Having enough troubles, no other team was send. If the people did not lie, they should be safe. At least for now.
