Taming will be a rather complex process with a lot of different factors plaing a role. The fundamental idea of taming is
 an alternative to fighting and catching. Taming will need the player to find correct social interactions with the beast,
 so that it is more inclined to be friendly towards the player.
 ##Start of the Battle
 At the start the difficulty of the taming will be evaluated. The difficulty will result mainly from the level, type and nature of the beast.
 If the littleBeast has a different nature than the player character it will be more difficult to tame it. 
 Also a higher level will make it more difficult and sometimes even impossible to tame it. 

##The Taming Process
The player will need to start the taming process with the taming ability. Depending on the nature of the player they will
get different options for interactions with the littleBeast. These options can pursuade the littleBeast to join your ranks, 
but some of the options presented to the player will not help in taming a littleBeast an other will even chase the littleBeast 
away. So the players need to choose carefully, which options they take. 
A beast will not sit idlely while players try to tame it. It will attack the player and if the taming process takes too long even escape.
The taming ability can also be leveled up as any other skill.

##Why would you Tame if you can Catch?
Taming will bring additional perks, a beast, which is tamed and not cought will have a better 'friendship' with the player
and therefor perform better in battle. Additional perks can be added to balance the effort to tame.

##Ending the Taming Process
When the player thinks they have pursuaded the beast to come with them, they can try to use a collar on the littleBeast.
The collar is a one time use item, which can be bought at vendors. When a collar is used all the taming interactions the 
player has done will culminate and compared to the difficulty of taming the beast. When both numbers are the same there 
is a 50-50 chance of catching the beast. The rest of the probabilities are roughly normal distributed.
