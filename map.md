The maps will be managed with the LITIengine utiLITI software. The map has to be created as \*.tmx file in a tile map editor and the used tiles also need to be imported as tileset it a \*.tsx format.
All the editing of tiles will be done in pixel editor like for instance Krita or just plain Paint. Then the map can be created with a tile map editor like tiled. 
The \*.tmx and \*.tsx are XML formats which store the information in plain text. The utiLITI software then exports all resources to a file (convetionally named "game.litidata") which can then be imported to the Java project with ```Resources.load``` and called with their in the utiLITI software created names.
