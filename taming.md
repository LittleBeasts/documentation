It has been 6 months now, since the meteorite fell down to earth. No one saw it comming, but every one saw the green flash when it hit [Arkham City](https://github.com/LittleBeasts/documentation/wiki/Arkham-City).
The city centre was destroyed and the dust cloud rising from the impact enveloped the whole world. Since then nothing has been the same. 
First all the animals vanished, then first whispers and then roumors started whem people claimed, they saw strange beasts in the wilderness surounding Arkham City. 
Now these littleBeasts are no rumours anymore, they roam the cities and regions surrounding it. Some seem peaceful, but others are vicious and a danger to people. Some stated interacting with the littleBeasts and even had succes taming them, others try to hunt them and catch them. 

Your dog/cat is the last existing animal and your trusted companion. With it by your side you try to tame the littleBeasts and fight against the dangers in the wild and cities. You seem to have a special knack to interact with the littleBeasts and you companion is always of good help.

Around Arkham there are four distinct regions with their own dangers:
To the west there are the vast [marshlands](https://github.com/LittleBeasts/documentation/wiki/The-Marshlands) with the habour city Insmouth. Here the dangers are the muddy paths and the littleBeasts inhabiting them. The city itself also holds its mystery. What are the people of Insmouth using the littleBeasts for?

To the north there is [Dunwich](https://github.com/LittleBeasts/documentation/wiki/Dunwich). It lies in the great planes. Here heards of littleBeasts have formed and some have even been tamed by a new breed of Cowboys.
	
In the east lie the [Miscatonik Mountains](https://github.com/LittleBeasts/documentation/wiki/Miskatonic-Mountains). This treacherous region has evil rumours surrounding it, which seem even stranger than the littleBeasts. People have been lost and even the littleBeasts seem to be cautios of these parts.

In the south there is the [Ivory Forest](https://github.com/LittleBeasts/documentation/wiki/Ivory-Forest). Here the most dangerous littleBeasts have formed packs which attack unsuspecting people and even other littleBeasts. But something lurks inside this unpenetrable thicket.


Some of the meteor dust has settled to form small droplets, which can be used to control the littleBeasts. These droplets can be found in the wilderness and are sometimes traded. But be aware that the use of them can make you loose your mind.
