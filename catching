The catching ability will be a general skill of the player.With this ability the can try to catch a littleBeast. 

This actual chance will be influenced by different factors:
- HP of the littleBeast
- Level of the player
- Skill level of the catching skill
- Items

Generally speaking will a littleBeast have a difficulty to catch it and the player will have different boons to help them catch it.
When the difficulty and the boons are equal there will be a 50-50 chance of success.
And the rest will be roughly modeled after normal distribution.
