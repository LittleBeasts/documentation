## The Crater

The Miskatonic University has always been known for their strange experiments and professors who are not conserned with the well-being of their students. But on the day of the solar eclipse something happened which even for the standard of the University has to be considered astounding. They were able to evacuate the whole campus while a meteor fell down to earth. No one has seen it comming but it fell down in an extraordarily slow pace. The impact was devastating nevertheless and nothing would be left of the old univerity buildings. The dust cloud could be seen from miles away and the resulting crater is more than a 100 feet deep. 
Since then the FBI took control of the crater and no one but a few researchers are allowed into the site. They try to find any clues to where the meteor came from and how it could not be spotted any earlier. Lukily the damage from the impact was limited to the university.

## New Miskatonic Campus
A new campus had to be build so the costructions started right after the impact. A lot of external interest helped fund the project and in no time everything was up and running again. A lot of scientist from all around the world gathered at the new Miskatonic University to study the impact of the meteor and especially the dust with which the whole region was engulfed. 
Additionally the phenomens surrounding the sudden dissapearing of all the animals couldn't be ignored and the arrival of the littleBeasts was a focus of the scientific community.

## The Fog
With the crater came the fog. Most of the time it stays inside the crater but on some nights it fills the streets of Arkham. On these night strange things happen in the city, people go missing, things go missing and sometimes it is just thoughts that go missing.

## Flea Market
Right at the Miskatonic River there is the 'Flea Market'. It is an underground market where you can aquire hard to get items. Since the crater the items they deal with have gotten even stranger and more dangerous. At the market you can find anyone who desperately needs something no one else is willing to sell. The prices can be steep and currency is favors.
