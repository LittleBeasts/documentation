## The Way to Innsmouth
Year after year people get lost in the marshlands around Innsmouth. The roads are difficult to travel and strange lights can lead travellers along the wrong path, and once you are off the road, it is hard to get back on the right track.
With the arrival of the littleBeasts the region has become even more dangerous. The beasts adapted quickly to the swamps and know how to use the terrain to their advantage. They lure people deep into the swamps with a strange humming noise which a lot of people can't resist.

## Innsmouth
Even when you find your way through the marshlands you will not be greeted kindly in Innsmouth. The people here have always been secretive and are more comfortable when left alone. But with the arrival of the littleBeasts this small habour town has started to gain an economic boost. They catch littleBeasts from the ocean and sell them into the whole world. It is not easy to catch the beasts under the sea and no one knows, how the fishermen of Innsmouth are so successful and they are not willing to share their secrets.

## The Ocean
People tell of the strange color the water has around Innsmouth and how they claim to have seen people, who walked right into it, only to come out hours later unfazed. What is true about these roumors and why will no one talk about the things that are happening in Innsmouth. It seems like something is in the water, just waiting to get out. 

## The Ocean Floor
Under the sea there are littleBeasts, which adapted quickly to the oceans, but they are not the only thing in these depths. When the full moon shines the Children of Dagon arise from the depths to claim what is theirs, and the people of Innsmouth are willing to give it.
