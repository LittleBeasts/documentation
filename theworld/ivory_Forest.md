# The past

Before the meteorite fell down to earth and destroyed life as we knew it. Ivory Forest was a beautiful and stunning place. It was wonderful and many animals called it their home. It had huge green Trees, wich were full of birds, squirrels and reptiles. The ground was very furtile and inhabited by large groups of Boars, foxes, cats and many more. The citizens of Arkham City also enjoyed the peacefulness and relaxation of Ivory Forest. They sometimes went for a relaxing walk, but never tried to harm the forest and its inhabitants. Everyone lived in peace with each other. But then the Meteorite came and everything changed....

# The Meteorite
At the moment the meteorite hit a huge cloud of debris, stardust and fire was released into the air. It expanded and blacked out the sun for almost a week. Because of the shock and all the dust no one really thought about Ivory Forest and what a great place it has been. But when the dust settled and the people started to take a look outside of the citys borders. It really made sure everyone knew. The life we know is over...

# The aftermath
While the enormous cloud went through Ivory Forest, some of its dust settled on top of leaves and plants which absorbed it over time. And the whole forest started to turn white and grey. Although the trees seemed to be dead, they soon started growing with an unnatural amount of speed. By now the tree tops are so close together that only a bit of sunshine hardly makes it through. It became a really dark and scary place for most people which many feared to enter. Some were brave enough to enter but never came back and their bodies will never be found. Often strange sounds and screams are heared while standing at the south city border. No one really knows what now lurks inside the dark of this mysterious forest. But everyone knows, only the bravest and strongest will dare to take a step inside.

# What Lurks inside
The meteor also brought new life to Ivory Forest. Besides the littleBeasts, a new species was found, the Vhyll‘Resh. The Vhyll‘Resh are a reincarnation of haunted restless souls which died inside of Ivory Forest. The Vhyll‘Resh are formed out of Roots, which encapsulate their whole body. Inside of their Chest a colorful glow can be seen. The color indicates how they feel. The glow of these strange creatures comes from their souls. The roots are forming some kind of cage around the soul which is trapped inside. These haunted souls are also called „the color“. Sometimes it can also be found roaming around the forest but that‘s very rare. The Vhyll‘Resh are not the friendliest creatures. They often attack out of nowhere and really do blend in with they‘re environment nicely. ![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/e/e8/Spriggan_detail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111124210250)

# The Scenery
Ivory Forest became a dark and feared place. All trees got white and while they seem dead. There‘s still a strange force letting them feel alive. Ivory Forest is huge it grows over an area of hundreds of kilometers. Inside of Ivory Forest debris of the meteor strike can often be found. It either hangs in the trees or is almost completely overgrown on the ground. While walking through Ivory Forest you feel watched. As if every step you take gets absorbed and processed. Inside of Ivory Forest some left houses can also be found, sometimes even little villages which hold their own small little mysteries.

# The Cathedral
With the Vhyll‘Resh another strange building appeared. A huge kind of cathedral in the middle of the forest. It‘s completely made out of Roots but covered in Leaves, vines and some kind of strange green and blue slime. Which drips down from it‘s roof. Near of this cathedral no life at all can be found. It almost seems like the littleBeasts and also the Vhyll‘Resh are afraid of this place. And they also don‘t want to talk about it. Inside of this Cathedral is a dark room, which is covered in vines where you can hear the slime dripping down the walls otherwise it‘s almost completely silent except for a strange but not very loud humming sound. The room seems empty at first glance but as you go further inside, you feel more and more empty, as if somebody would suck your soul and life energy out of your body. Suddenly you’re standing in front of a huge hole. As you look down inside, everything is pitch black except for one little blue reflection at the end. It seems like it‘s calling your name. Suddenly out of nowhere a v0ine grabs you and you‘re getting pulled into the dark...

As you wake up, you‘re covered in slime. You‘re trying to stand up and all you‘re senses are slowly coming back. You hear the strange humming sound again but much much louder. You turn around and you can see its origin. Right in front of you is a huge Portal. The Portal is made out of roots and vines like the rest of the temple. But it‘s surrounded by huge vines which are moving. You look around. Above you there is the huge hole, where you got dragged down. There seems like no way out of this chamber. You basically only got two choices either go into this strange and slimey portal or you‘ll die in this forest and become fertilizer for its huge ecosystem like many brave adventurers before you. So you‘re going to enter the portal. As soon as you entered the portal. You feel like your body gets ripped apart molecule by molecule. But as soon as you open your eyes again you‘re standing in the middle of a huge city. Where you can hear a lot of painful screams. The City is completely covered in green vines, roots, slime and algea. Where are you? As you turn around a huge Creature is standing on the horizon. And you realize you‘re in Yrr’Lyeh the City and dimension of Vh‘yrr‘kll the hunter of souls.

# Vh‘yrr‘kll
Vh‘yrr‘kll or the hunter of souls is a huge monster which lives from the unimaginable suffering of haunted souls. He hunt‘s them not only for live essence but also for fun. He gains his strength from the pain and suffering the souls have to go through while in his captivity. He has a head like a huge deer, but the rest of him almost seems human like.Roots are growing out of his chest which wrap around his arms and schoulders. <br>

# The inhabitants of Yrr’Lyeh
 In Vh‘yrr‘klls city many of ‚the color‘ creatures are roaming around but also many strange creatures which are almost human like but with a head of a dear. These Creatures are called the Vhidruxrr. They‘re evil creatures which torture the souls (the Color) and are Vh‘yrr‘klls minions. The worst thing that could happen to a soul is getting reincarnated as a Vhyll‘Resh.
