# CalculationEngine

The core of our game will be the "CalculationEngine". It will provide all necessary features in order to run the game and calculate Events. It will basically implement the whole Batlle Structure consisting of: Taming, Catching, Damage and Loot. The CalculationEngine has to be modular and well thoughtout because it will be used in the game itself while beeing in single player and it will be used in the multiplayer server to calculate and process inputs from players / clients in battle and on the map. This has to be kept in mind while designing and implementing it.
